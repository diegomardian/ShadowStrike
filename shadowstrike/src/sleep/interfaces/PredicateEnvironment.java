/**
 * <p>Predicate environments are similar to normal keyword environments except instead of binding commands to an identifier 
 * they are bound to a predicate condition.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In general the sleep syntax for declaring a predicate environment is:</p>
 * 
 * <code>keyword (condition) { commands; }</code>
 *  
 * <p>Script predicate environment bridge keywords should be registered with the script parser before any scripts are 
 * loaded.  This can be accomplished as follows:</p>
 * 
 * <code>ParserConfig.addKeyword("keyword");</code>
 * 
 * <p>To install a new predicate environment into the script environment:</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ScriptInstance script;              // assume
 * Environment    myEnvironmentBridge; // assume
 * 
 * Hashtable environment = script.getScriptEnvironment().getEnvironment();
 * environment.put("keyword", myEnvironmentBridge);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>Predicate environments are a powerful way to create environments that are triggered selectively.  Predicate 
 * environments can also be used to add new constructs to the sleep language such as an unless (comparison) { } 
 * construct.</p>
