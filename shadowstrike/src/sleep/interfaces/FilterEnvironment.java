/**
 * <p>Filtered environments are similar to normal keyword environments except they also allow a parameter 
 * specified by the user.  The identifier and parameter are both sent to the bridge when a block of code 
 * is bound to a particular filtered environment keyword.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In general the syntax for binding a filtered environment is:</p>
 * 
 * <code>keyword identifier "parameter" { code; }</code>
 * 
 * <p>One thing worth noting is that when the "parameter" string gets passed to the class implementing this interface, 
the 
 * "parameter" will be unevaluated.  So if the "parameter" was an expression i.e. (2 + 2), the value passed back to the
 * interface would be the string "(2 + 2)".  To evaluate the parameter use the following code:</p>
 * 
 * <pre>ScriptEnvironment environment = script.getScriptEnvironment();
 * Scalar value = environment.evaluateExpression(parameter);</pre>
 * 
 * <p>Script filtered environment bridge keywords should be registered with the script parser before any scripts are
 * loaded.  This can be accomplished as follows:</p>
 * 
 * <code>ParserConfig.addKeyword("keyword");</code>
 * 
 * <p>To install a new filtered environment into the script environment:</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ScriptInstance script;              // assume
 * FilterEnvironment    myEnvironmentBridge; // assume
 * 
 * Hashtable environment = script.getScriptEnvironment().getEnvironment();
 * environment.put("keyword", myEnvironmentBridge);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>Filter environments are really just an extension of the normal environment bridges.  In particular filter 
 * environments can be used to implement event listener mechanisms or as an expansion fornormal environment bridges that 
 * might require a parameter.</p>
 *

 * @see sleep.parser.ParserConfig#addKeyword(String)
