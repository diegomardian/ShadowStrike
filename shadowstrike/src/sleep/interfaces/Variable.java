 * <p>A variable bridge is a container for storing scalars.  A variable bridge is nothing more than a container.  It is 
 * possible to use a new variable container to alter how scalars are stored and accessed.  All scalars, scalar arrays, and 
 * scalar hashes are stored using this system. </p>
 *  
 * <p>A Variable bridge is installed by creating a new script variable manager with the new variable bridge.   The variable 
 * manager is then installed into a given script.</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ScriptVariables variableManager = new ScriptVariable(new MyVariable());
 * script.setScriptVariables(variableManager);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>Sleep scripts can share variables by using the same instance of ScriptVariables.  A Variable bridge can be used to 
 * create built in variables.  Every time a certain scalar is accessed the bridge might call a method and return the value 
 * of the method as the value of the accessed scalar.</p>
