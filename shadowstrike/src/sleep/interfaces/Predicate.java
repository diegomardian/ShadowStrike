/**
 * <p>A predicate is an operator used inside of comparisons.  Comparisons are used in if statements and loop constructs.  
 * Sleep supports two types of predicates.  A unary predicate which takes one argument.  The other type is a binary 
 * (normal) predicate which takes two arguments.   In the example comparison a == b, a is the left hand side, b is the 
 * right hand side, and == is the predicate.  Predicate bridges are used to add new predicates to the language.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To install a predicate into a script environment:</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ScriptInstance script;           // assume
 * Predicate      myPredicateBridge; // assume
 * 
 * Hashtable environment = script.getScriptEnvironment().getEnvironment();
 * environment.put("isPredicate", myPredicateBridge);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>In the above code snippet the script environment is extracted from the script instance class. 
 * A binary predicate can have any name.  A unary predicate always begins with the - minus symbol.  "isin" would be 
 * considered a binary predicate where as "-isletter" would be considered a unary predicate.</p>
