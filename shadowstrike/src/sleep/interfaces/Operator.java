/**
 * <p>An operator in sleep parlance is anything used to operate on two variables inside of an expression.  For example 2 + 3 
 * is the expression add 2 and 3.  The + plus sign is the operator.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Creating an Operator class and installing it into the environment makes the operator available for use within 
 * expressions.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To install an operator into a script environment:</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ScriptInstance script;           // assume
 * Operator       myOperatorBridge; // assume
 * 
 * Hashtable environment = script.getScriptEnvironment().getEnvironment();
 * environment.put("operator", myOperatorBridge);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>Operator bridges probably won't be as common as other bridges.  Operator bridges can be used for adding new math 
 * operators or new string manipulation operators.</p>
