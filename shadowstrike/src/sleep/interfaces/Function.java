/**
 * <p>A function bridge is used to define a built-in function.  Once a function bridge is installed into the script 
 * environment, it can be called from user created scripts.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An example of a function bridge:</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class MyAddFunction implements Function
 * {
 *    public Scalar evaluate(String name, ScriptInstance script, Stack arguments) 
 *    {
 *       if (name.equals("&add"))
 *       {
 *          int a = BridgeUtilities.getInt(arguments, 0);  
 *          int b = BridgeUtilities.getInt(arguments, 0); 
 *  
 *          return SleepUtils.getScalar(a + b); 
 *       }
 * 
 *       return SleepUtils.getEmptyScalar();
 *    }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>To install a function into a script environment:</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ScriptInstance script;           // assume
 * 
 * Function  myFunctionBridge = new MyAddFunction();
 * Hashtable environment      = script.getScriptEnvironment().getEnvironment();
 * 
 * environment.put("&add", myFunctionBridge);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>In the above code snippet the script environment is extracted from the ScriptInstance object script.  The function 
 * name is the key with the instance of our Function bridge as the value.   The function name must begin with & ampersand 
 * for sleep to know it is a function.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Once a function bridge is installed into the script environment.  The installed function(s) can be called as normal
 * sleep functions i.e.</p>
 * 
 * <code>$var = add(3, 4); # value of $var is now 7</code>
 * 
 * <p>To evaluate a Function object (should you ever need to directly evaluate one):</p>
 *
 *
 * <pre>// assume Function func; ScriptInstance script; Stack locals
 *
 * Scalar value = SleepUtils.runCode(func, "&name", script, locals);</pre>
 *
 * <p>The above is important because it clears the return value in the script environment once the function finishes executing.
 * Failing to clear the return value can result in other sleep code not executing at all.  It is not a fun bug to track down.</p>
 *
 * @see sleep.bridges.BridgeUtilities
 * @see sleep.runtime.ScriptInstance
 * @see sleep.runtime.SleepUtils
