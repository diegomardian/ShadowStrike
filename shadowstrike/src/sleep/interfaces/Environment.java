/**
 * <p>Blocks of code associated with an identifier are processed by their environment.  An example of an environment is the 
 * subroutine environment.   To declare a subroutine in sleep you use:</p>
 * 
 * <code>sub identifier { commands; }</code>
 * 
 * <p>When sleep encounters this code it looks for the environment bound to the keyword "sub".  It passes the environment 
 * for "sub" a copy of the script instance, the identifier, and the block of executable code.  The environment can do 
 * anything it wants with this information.   The subroutine environment simply creates a Function object with the block of code and 
 * installs it into the environment.  Thus allowing scripts to declare custom subroutines.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In general a block of code is associated with an environment using the following syntax:</p>
 * 
 * <code>keyword identifier { commands; } # sleep code</code>
 * 
 * <p>Script environment bridge keywords should be registered with the script parser before any scripts are loaded.  This 
 * can be accomplished as follows:</p>
 * 
 * <code>ParserConfig.addKeyword("keyword");</code>
 * 
 * <p>To install a new environment into the script environment:</p>
 * <pre>
 * ScriptInstance script;              // assume
 * Environment    myEnvironmentBridge; // assume
 * 
 * Hashtable environment = script.getScriptEnvironment().getEnvironment();
 * environment.put("keyword", myEnvironmentBridge);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>The Block object passed to the environment can be executed using:</p>
 * 
 * <code>SleepUtils.runCode(commands, instance.getScriptEnvironment());</code>
 * 
 * <p>Environment bridges are great for implementing different types of paradigms. I've used this feature to add everything 
 * from event driven scripting to popup menu structures to my application. Environments are a very powerful way to get the 
 * most out of integrating your application with the sleep language.</p>
