/**
 * Runtime errors are caught by sleep.  Examples of a runtime error include calling a function that doesn't exist, using an 
 * operator that doesn't exist, or causing an exception in the underlying javacode.  Whenever any of these events occurs 
 * the event is isolated and turned into a ScriptWarning object.  The Script Warning object is then propagated to all 
 * registered warning watchers.
 * <br>
 * <br>To create a runtime warning watcher: 
 * <br>
 * <pre>
 * public class Watchdog implements RuntimeWarningWatcher
 * {   
 *    public void processScriptWarning(ScriptWarning warning)    
 *    {
 *       String message = warning.getMessage();      
 *       int    lineNo  = warning.getLineNumber();
 *       String script  = warning.getNameShort(); // name of script 
 *    }
 * }
 * </pre> 
 * To register a warning watcher:
 * <br>
 * <br><code>script.addWarningWatcher(new Watchdog());</code>
 * 
 * @see sleep.runtime.ScriptInstance
 * @see sleep.error.ScriptWarning
